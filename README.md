# HateSpeechDetection
Built various classification models in order to detect which tweet was hate speech or otherwise. 
## Hate Speech Detection
The number of social media users continue to grow everyday because of the advance of technology. As a result, most people spend the major part of their day on these media platforms either reading other people's opinions, sharing their own opinions or even responding to the opinions of others. There are people who in the bid to pass across their message, say hurtful things to others with respect to their age, race or sexuality. This is what we refer to as hate speech.
As a society, there is a pressing need to reduce the spread of hate speech on social media platforms or at least try to. States and governments have put in place laws that punish those violating these legislation. However, the law can only punish if the offenders are caught. A number of people on these platforms are anonymous and due to the lack of stringent verification process in registering on social media platforms, they sometimes remain untraceable. This is why as scientist, we must also use our skills to develop ways and improve on measures, algorithms to help prevent hate speech on social media.
In this project, I researched techniques that researchers have explored in the field of hate speech detection especially with the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My work particularly focuses on machine learning algorithms and concludes by using the best one based on the evaluation metrics chosen to predict hate speech in a sentence.

## About dataset
The data set used for this research was publicly sourced and collected from Kaggle. The data was first published four years ago by Raul Agarwal and has become very popular for hate speech analysis and detection with a total of 34691 views and 5306 downloads. The data set contains two files i.e. the test and train data. The train data set was used to train the model while the other was used to test the accuracy of the model.
